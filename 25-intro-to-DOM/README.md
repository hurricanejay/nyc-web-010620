# Intro to the DOM ðŸ“œ

## Three things that JS allows us to do:

1. Account for user interaction
2. Interact with the web page (DOM)
3. Run requests

## SWBATs

- [ ] Draw DOM tree by looking at HTML
- [ ] Explain what a DOM node is and what its most important attributes are
- [ ] Use the Chrome Dev tools to explore the DOM tree and its attributes
- [ ] Use JS to select DOM nodes
- [ ] Use JS to add, remove, and edit DOM nodes

### The Document Object Model Overview
- What is the DOM?
  - The DOM (Document Object Model) is a representation of an HTML document as a **tree** (more on this later) that can be manipulated with JavaScript
  - Javascript is a language created to manipulate the DOM
  - "[JavaScript] DOM methods allow programmatic access to the tree; with them you can change the document's structure, style or content." - [MDN DOM Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model) (more on this later)

## The DOM is a Tree ðŸŽ„

- What is a tree in computer science? A data structure that represents some hierarchical structure; parent nodes (elements), child nodes, sibling nodes. Trees look like upside down trees:

- Here is another representation of a tree with a root node and several children or branches:

- Here is a representation of our HTML as a tree. This is the DOM:

- DOM (Document Object Model)
  - The DOM is a tree structure with several child `nodes`. All of the elements in the tree are related to each other. Some elements may have children:

```html
<body>
  <div >
    <h1>Welcome to the DOM Dominion</h1>
    <p>A magical land of trees and <em>mystical</em> properties</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Explore the trees</li>
      <li>Discover mystical properties</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</body>
```

---

- This tree structure starts at the `document`, where `document` is the topmost **parent** of each individual `node` (HTML Element). Every single HTML element in the DOM is a `node`: `<p></p>`, `<h1></h1>`, `<img>`, etc. **If you are not comfortable with HTML syntax and/or HTML tags, go through the [intro to HTML section on W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp)**
- JavaScript allows us to **traverse** this tree to find and _manipulate_ different `nodes` (we'll see how in a bit).
  - "The DOM model represents a document with a logical tree. Each branch of the tree ends in a node, and each node
    contains objects. DOM methods allow programmatic access to the tree; with them you can change the document's
    structure, style or content." -
    [MDN Article on the DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model)
- Elements (`nodes`) have properties that can be manipulated (`style`, `textContent`, `innerHTML`, etc). In this particular example, we'll be manipulating the `.src` attribute of some `img` tags.
- Element interfaces
  - Different elements (`table`, `p`, `image`) support different methods
    - `image.src`, for instance
    - `document.body.style.backgroundColor = 'red'`
  - Refer to the documentation for each element you wish to manipulate to find out which properties/attributes you can manipulate. - [MDN HTML Element Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element)

### DOM CRUD

- READ:

- `document.getElementById`
  - returns the first child element with that id
- `node.getElementsByTagName`
  - returns an HTML Collection of all the elements with a specified tag, only searches descendents of the node
- `node.getElementsByClassName`
  - returns a collection of nodes with a specified class name
- `node.querySelector`
  - returns the first child that matches the CSS selector
- `node.querySelectorAll`
  - returns a collection of descendent elements that match the CSS selector
  - We can also combine selectors for more specificity:
    - We need a space between `#parent .child`
    - We can chain selectors `div.image.highlighted`
    - We can search for siblings with `~`

---

- UDATE:

- We can change/add any attribute of a `node`. Example: `body.style.backgroundColor = red`
  - this will either update the `style.backgroudColor` if one already exists, or add a `style.backgroundColor` if one does not exist
- `innerText`/`textContent`
- `innerHTML`

---

- DELETE:

- `node.removeChild(childNode)`
- `node.remove()`

---

- CREATE:

- `document.createElement`
- `document.body.appendChild(element)`
