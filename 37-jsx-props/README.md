JSX & Props
=============================

## SWBATs
- [ ] Understand how `create-react-app` works and what it offers a developer
- [ ] Organize code into files and use the import-export syntax to pass ddata between components
- [ ] Use props to make components more dynamic and reusable
- [ ] Setup a new React app and play around with building UIs
- [ ] **BONUS** Use the `children` prop 

## Notes

- writing functional components
- starting to write class components (just general syntax)
- props... passing them from parent to child and tracking that 
- array mapping to render multiple children and that KEYYYYYY *** reminder to self 
- making tiny little changes and testing them... often
